# goal-oriented-learning
Implementation of goal oriented learning for world value functions in the tabular case for a simple 4rooms grid world. This code is an implementation of goal oriented learning proposed in [Nangue Tasse et al. 2020]. 

## Environment
- Simple gym.Env implementation of 4 rooms gridworld.
- Goal oriented
  - Desirable & undesirable goals are set
- Deterministic
