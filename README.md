# goal-oriented-learning
Implementation of goal oriented learning for world value functions in the tabular case for a simple 4rooms grid world. This code is an implementation of goal oriented learning proposed in [Nangue Tasse et al. 2020]. 

## Required Packages
This repo requires minimal non-standard libraries. The only external libraries required are:
1. numpy
2. gym
3. tqdm (This is for the progress bar)

## Environment
- Simple gym.Env implementation of 4 rooms gridworld.
- Goal oriented
  - Desirable & undesirable goals can be specified
- Deterministic

## Collaboration
- If there are any issues with this code please create an issue on this repo.
- If you wish to contribute improvements or additions please make a pull request
